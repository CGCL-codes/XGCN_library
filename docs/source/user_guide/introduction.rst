Introduction
================

The "USER GUIDE" section is for those who want to quickly get started 
and run models on existing datasets or new datasets made by their own. 

The users only need to focus on preparing the raw dataset input 
and setting model configurations. 
We provide APIs such as ``XGCN.data.edges_split`` to split data for link prediction task. 
Users can easily run a model through the ``XGCN.main.run_model`` module.
