Overview
================

The "User Guide" section is for those who want to quickly get started 
and run models on existing datasets or new datasets made by their own using XGCN. 

An overview of the running pipeline is shown in the figure below:

XGCN supports process raw text files or DGLGraph and 
specifiy a standard "dataset instance" format which is used by all the downstream models. 
Once a dataset instance is generated, you can easily run models with XGCN's 
command line (CMD) interfaces  or API functions. 

In the following, we'll introduce how to use XGCN from the four aspects below:

* **Data Preparation**

* **Training and Evaluation**

* **Supported Models**

* **Running Examples**
