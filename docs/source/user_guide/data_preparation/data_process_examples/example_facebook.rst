Dara Processing Example 1: facebook
=====================================

Let's begin with a small dataset: facebook.
The data is included in our XGCN repository: 
``data/raw_facebook/``. You can also download it from SNAP: 
`facebook_combined.txt.gz <http://snap.stanford.edu/data/facebook_combined.txt.gz>`_. 

Here we assume that we don't have existing evaluation set 
and want to split some edges for model evaluation.
(If you like to do the data process in JupyterNotebook, please refer to 
``script/data_process/facebook/dataset_instance_making.ipynb``.)
